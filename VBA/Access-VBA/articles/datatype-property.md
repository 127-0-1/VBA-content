# DataType Property



**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

You can use the  **DataType** property to specify the type of data stored in a table field. Each field can store data consisting of only a single data type.


## Setting

The  **DataType** property uses the following settings.



| <strong>Setting</strong> | <strong>Type of data</strong>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | <strong>Size</strong>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| OLE Object               | An object (such as a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet, a Microsoft Word document, graphics, sounds, or other binary data) linked to or embedded in a Microsoft Access table.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Up to 1 gigabyte (limited by available disk space)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Hyperlink                | Text or combinations of text and numbers stored as text and used as a hyperlink address. A hyperlink address can have up to four parts: <em>text to display —</em> the text that appears in a field or control. <em>address</em> — the path to a file (UNC path) or page (URL). <em>subaddress</em> — a location within the file or page. <em>screentip</em> — the text displayed as a tooltip. | Each part of the parts of a Hyperlink data type can contain up to 2048 characters.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Attachment               | Any supported type of file                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | You can attach images, spreadsheet files, documents, charts, and other types of supported files to the records in your database, much like you attach files to e-mail messages. You can also view and edit attached files, depending on how the database designer sets up the Attachment field. Attachment fields provide greater flexibility than OLE Object fields, and they use storage space more efficiently because they don't create a bitmap image of the original file. |
| Lookup Wizard            | Creates a field that allows you to choose a value from another table or from a list of values by using a list box or combo box. Clicking this option starts the Lookup Wizard, which creates a Lookup field. After you complete the wizard, Microsoft Access sets the data type based on the values selected in the wizard.                                                                     | The same size as the primary key field used to perform the lookup, typically 4 bytes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

You can set this property only in the upper portion of table Design view.

In Visual Basic , you can use the ADO  **Type** property to set a field's data type before appending it to the **Fields** collection.


## Remarks

Memo, Hyperlink, and OLE Object fields can't be indexed.


 **Tip**   Use the Currency data type for a field requiring many calculations involving data with one to four decimal places. **Single** and **Double** data type fields require floating-point calculation. The Currency data type uses a faster fixed-point calculation.


 **Caution**  Changing a field's data type after you enter data in a table causes a potentially lengthy process of data conversion when you save the table. If the data type in a field conflicts with a changed  **DataType** property setting, you may lose some data.

Set the  **Format** property to specify a predefined display format for Number, Date/Time, Currency, and Yes/No data types.

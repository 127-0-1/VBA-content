
# ReturnVar Object (Access)

Represents a variable that was initialized by the  **SetReturnVar** function in a Data Macro.


## Remarks

A  **ReturnVar** object provides a convenient way to use values set in a Data Macro.

Although a  **ReturnVar** object can be used to store information for use in VBA procedures, it does not have the same functionality as a VBA variable.


- By default, a  **ReturnVar** object remains in memory until the next time that the **[RunDataMacro](e95b7a8e-a502-67c6-1941-dd5a06c08ef7.md)** method is used.
    
    Use the Value poperty of the ReturnVar
    
- A  **ReturnVar** object can store only text or numeric data. **ReturnVar** objects cannot store objects.
    
To refer to a TempVar object in a collection by its ordinal number or by its Name property setting, use the following syntax form:




```
ReturnVars![name] 

```

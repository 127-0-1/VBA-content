The following procedure compacts and repairs a database, creates a log if there is any corruption in the source file, and returns a  **Boolean** value based on whether the recovery was successful.


```Visual Basic

' Example driver application.
Sub Test()

    Dim repaired As Boolean

    ' You can simply make up a name for the destination file.
    repaired = RepairDatabase("C:\Users\Public\Documents\Database.accdb", _
                              "C:\Users\Public\Documents\DatabaseRepaired.accdb")

    MsgBox repaired

End Sub

' Input values: The fully-qualified path names of the source and destination
' database files.
Function RepairDatabase(sourceDb As String, destDb As String) As Boolean
 
    ' Compact and repair the database. You can use the return value of the
    ' CompactRepair method to determine if the file was successfully compacted.
    RepairDatabase = Access.Application.CompactRepair(sourceDb, destDb, True)

End Function

```

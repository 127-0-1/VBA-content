Microsoft Outlook/Exchange IISAM uses the Messaging API (MAPI) to obtain folder or address book information. To get MAPI onto your machine you must install one of the Microsoft e-mail clients that uses MAPI, such as Outlook Client, Outlook Express, or Exchange Client. Until you do this, the Outlook/Exchange IISAM cannot work.

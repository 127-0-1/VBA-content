A tab control contains multiple pages on which you can place other controls, such as text boxes or option buttons. When a user clicks the corresponding tab, that page becomes active.

With the tab control, you can construct a single form or dialog box that contains several different tabs, and you can group similar options or data on each tab's page. For example, you might use a tab control on an Employees form to separate general and personal information.

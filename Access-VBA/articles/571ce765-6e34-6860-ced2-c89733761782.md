You tried to execute a query that contains more than one destination field with the same name.

Possible cause:


- You created an SQL statement that includes an INSERT INTO, SELECT...INTO, or UPDATE statement that lists the specified field name more than once.
    

Remove the duplicate fields or alias the destination field names, and try the operation again.

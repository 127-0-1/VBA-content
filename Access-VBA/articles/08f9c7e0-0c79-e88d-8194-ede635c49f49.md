
# Subqueries cannot be used in the expression <expression>. (Error 3203)

The specified expression contains a subquery or other expression that functions as a subquery.

Possible cause:


- You used a SELECT statement that includes an aggregate function that evaluates another aggregate function. This error occurs, for example, if you execute the following statement: 
    
  ```
  TRANSFORM Sum([OrderAmount]) AS Sum1 
SELECT Sum([Sum1]) AS Sum2, OrderID, Sum([Sum2]) AS Expr1 
FROM Orders 
GROUP BY OrderID 
PIVOT ShipName;
  ```


    The < _expression_ > parameter of the alert would contain the expression `Sum([Sum2])` from the SELECT clause, because this references an alias used in the same SELECT statement and acts as a subquery against `Sum([Sum1])`.

 **Last modified:** December 30, 2015

 _ **Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016_

Possible causes:



- The specified field is part of a  **TableDef** or dynaset-type **Recordset** object that cannot be updated. For example, this error occurs if you try to update an AutoNumber field.
    
- You executed a query that combines updatable and nonupdatable  **TableDef** objects, and you tried to update one of the fields in the query's results (the resulting dynaset-type **Recordset** ).

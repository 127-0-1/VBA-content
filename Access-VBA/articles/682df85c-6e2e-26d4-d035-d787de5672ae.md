 _ **Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016_

You have exceeded the maximum number of locks allowed on a recordset. This limit is specified by the MaxLocksPerFile setting in your system registry. The default value is 9500, and can be changed either by editing the registry with Regedit.exe or with the  **SetOption** method.

Some other factors that may cause an application to reach this threshold include the following:


- amount of available memory
    
- size of rows in the recordset
    
- network operating system restrictions

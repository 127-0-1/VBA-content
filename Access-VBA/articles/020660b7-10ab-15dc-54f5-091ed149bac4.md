The Microsoft Access database engine was unable to open an external Paradox table because of inconsistencies between the version of the table and your  **ParadoxNetStyle** setting in the Microsoft Windows Registry.

To correct the problem


1. Exit your application.
    
2. Start the Registry Editor, navigate to the  **HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\14.0\Access Connectivity Engine\Engines\Paradox** key, and select the **ParadoxNetStyle** value.
    
3. On the  **Edit** menu, click **Modify**.
    
4. Specify the value  **4.x** in the **Value data** box.
    
5. The  **ParadoxNetStyle** setting must be consistent for all users sharing a database.
    
6. Restart your application.
    
7. Try opening the table again.

You can use the IgnoreNulls property to specify that records with Null values in the indexed fields not be included in the index.

## Settings



|**Setting**|**Visual Basic**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Yes|**True**|Records that contain Null values in the indexed fields aren't included in the index.|
|No|**False**|(Default) Records that contain Null values in the indexed fields are included in the index.|
You can set this property by using the Indexes window of table Design view or Visual Basic.

To access the  **Ignore Nulls** property of an index by using Visual Basic, use the DAO **IgnoreNulls** property.

You can define an index for a field to facilitate faster searches for records indexed on that field. If you allow  **Null** entries in the indexed field and expect to have many of them, set the **Ignore Nulls** property for the index to Yes to reduce the amount of storage space that the index uses.

When a record is deleted at one replica, but updated at another replica, the deleted record always wins in the conflict that occurs when the two replicas synchronize. The updated record is logged in the conflict table. To reverse the initial resolution of the conflict, reinsert the conflict record. To accept the current resolution, delete the conflict record.

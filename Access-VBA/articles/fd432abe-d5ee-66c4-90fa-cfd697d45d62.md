Using an ODBC connection, you tried to delete data from an ODBC database; the deletion could not be completed.

Possible causes:


- The deletion would have caused a rule violation.
    
- The ODBC database is read-only, or you do not have permission to delete data in that database. Resolve the read-only condition, or see your system administrator or the person who created the database to obtain the necessary permissions.
    
- The ODBC database is on a network drive and the network is not connected. Make sure the network is available, and then try the operation again.

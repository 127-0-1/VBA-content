For details about why the exchange failed, look in the exchange history. If you are using Replication Manager, you can view the exchange history by right clicking on the replicated object. You can also view the replication history with the  **Synchronization History** command on the **View** menu.

If you are conducting replication with Microsoft Access, you can open the exchange history table in Datasheet view to see the exchange history. The exchange history table is a hidden object. Display it in the Database window by selecting the  **System Objects** check box on the **View** tab of the **Options** dialog box, which is available by clicking **Options** on the **Tools** menu.

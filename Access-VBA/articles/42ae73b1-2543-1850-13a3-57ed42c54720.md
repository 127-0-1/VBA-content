
# Join expression not supported. (Error 3296)

 **Last modified:** December 30, 2015

 _ **Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016_

Possible causes:



- Your SQL statement contains multiple joins in which the results of the query can differ, depending on the order in which the joins are performed. You may want to create a separate query to perform the first join, and then include that query in your SQL statement.
    
- The ON statement in your JOIN operation is incomplete or contains too many tables. You may want to put your ON expression in a WHERE clause.

Use the following code examples to learn how to use the ADO MD objects, methods, and properties. These examples are a subset of the sample applications installed with Microsoft SQL Server OLAP Services for SQL Server 7.0.

These examples use the MSOLAP OLE DB provider, and run against a Microsoft SQL Server OLAP Services local host. However, these examples are intended to show fundamental ADO MD programming techniques, and should be easily adapted to other data sources or providers.

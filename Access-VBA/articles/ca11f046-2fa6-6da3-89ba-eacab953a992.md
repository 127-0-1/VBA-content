You cannot replicate an object in a database unless you first replicate the database that contains it. You can replicate the database by:



- Dragging it into the Microsoft Windows Briefcase.
    
- Using DAO programming to set the  **Replicable** property to "T" or the **ReplicableBool** property to **True**.
    
- Using Microsoft Access.
    
- Using the Replication Manager.
    

All objects in the database are replicated when the database is replicated, unless the  **KeepLocal** property has been set on an object.

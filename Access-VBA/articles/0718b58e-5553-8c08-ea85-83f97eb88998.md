You are trying to save a value into a primary key field that is included in a relationship.

In Microsoft Access, the  **Cascade Update Related Fields** option is selected for the relationship, or in DAO code, the **dbRelationUpdateCascade** option is specified for the **Relation** object's **Attributes** property. Your application is attempting to update the matching field in the related table.
The matching field cannot be updated because of a locking conflict with another user. To save the record, you must wait until the related table is no longer in use.

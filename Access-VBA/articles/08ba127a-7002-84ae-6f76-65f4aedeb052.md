The Microsoft Access database engine attempted to update the database design at one of the replicas. There are several possible reasons why the design could not be updated, including:



- The object you are trying to update is already open at the replica.
    
- You added an enforced relationship to a replica that has a foreign key that references a nonexistent primary key.
    

For additional information regarding the synchronization failure, look in the MSysSchemaProb table, either at the Design Master or the replica that was the target of the synchronization.

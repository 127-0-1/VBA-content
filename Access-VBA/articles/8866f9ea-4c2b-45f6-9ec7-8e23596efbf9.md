 **Last modified:** December 30, 2015

 _ **Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016_

The specified name is not a recognized field name or a valid expression. In a query, this error can occur if you enter a name that improperly refers to a database, table, or field.

Possible causes with Microsoft Access:


- You have a parameter in a crosstab query or in a query that a crosstab query or chart is based on, and the parameter data type is not explicitly specified in the  **Query Parameters** dialog box. To solve the problem:
    
    
    
      - In the query that contains the parameter, specify the parameter and its data type in the  **Query Parameters** dialog box. And;
    
  - Set the  **ColumnHeadings** property for the query that contains the parameter.
    

    
    
- In any type of query, you have improperly referred to a database, table, or field. For example, this error can occur if you refer to a field named Salary in an expression, but you misspell the field name, such as  `[Sallary]*1.1`.

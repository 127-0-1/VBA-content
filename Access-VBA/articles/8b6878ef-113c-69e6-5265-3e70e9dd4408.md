This error can occur when you create a select query and specify grouped fields after sorted fields that are not grouped. For example, you created an SQL statement with the specified field out of sequence in the ORDER BY clause. Move the specified field to the left of the ungrouped fields, or remove the specified field from the ORDER BY clause.

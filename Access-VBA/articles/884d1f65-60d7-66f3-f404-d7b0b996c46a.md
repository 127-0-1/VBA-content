This error occurs when trying to create a view through SQL DDL. The error occurs when a different number of correlation names or aliases are defined from what is in the SELECT statement. For example, the following syntax would generate this error: CREATE VIEW foo (col1, col2) AS SELECT col1 FROM table1.

The syntax for calling ADO methods and properties differs depending upon your development environment. The rest of the ADO Language Reference uses the Microsoft Visual Basic programming language to illustrate ADO method and property syntax. However, refer to the sections below for more specific syntax examples based on your programming language and methodology.


- The [ADO for Visual C++ Syntax Index for COM](e016746e-07a8-10a1-b8e4-7dbb7f6cdaf2.md) covers ADO properties and methods without using the **#import** compiler directive with Microsoft Visual C++.
    
- The [ADO for Visual C++ Syntax Index with #import](68821c65-a96d-2524-d77c-030215db8e53.md) covers ADO properties and methods when using the **#import** compiler directive with Microsoft Visual C++.
    
- The [ADO/WFC Syntax Index](d49edfb1-bd76-b6cc-d023-753f4655ff11.md) covers using the ADO Windows Foundation Classes with Visual J++.

The Microsoft Access database engine was in the process of making the object replicable. The operation failed because there were insufficient resources to manipulate the object. If the object is a table, make sure the total number of fields after replication does not exceed 255 and the total number of bytes in a record does not exceed 2048. If the number of fields or characters is over the limit, decrease the size of the record.

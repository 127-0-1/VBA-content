
# Could not open Paradox.net. (Error 3172)

 **Last modified:** December 30, 2015

 _ **Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016_

Possible causes:



- The  **ParadoxNetPath** value in the \ **HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\14.0\Access Connectivity Engine\Engines\Paradox** Registry key is not valid. This error occurs if you are using the Paradox external database, and the **ParadoxNetPath** value points to a nonexistent directory. Exit the application, correct the invalid entry, and try the operation again.
    
- The  **ParadoxNetPath** Registry value points to a network drive, and you are not connected to that network drive. Make sure the network drive is available, and then try the operation again.

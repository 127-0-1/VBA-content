You are attempting to synchronize a replicated database with a non-replicated database or to synchronize two non-replicated databases. Only replicas made from the same replicated database can be synchronized.

If one of the databases has already been replicated, use it to create your second database replica.
If neither database has been replicated, select one of the databases to be used as the Design Master for the replica set. Open that database using Microsoft Access, go to the  **Tools** menu, point to **Replication**, and click **Create Replica**. If Microsoft Access is not available but Microsoft Windows 95 Briefcase is available, drag the database into the Briefcase to create a replica. Do not attempt to replicate the second of the two original databases and then synchronize the two databases. The second database must be a replica of the first for synchronization to succeed.

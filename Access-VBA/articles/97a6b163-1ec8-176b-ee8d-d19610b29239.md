 _ **Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016_

Possible causes:



- You tried to delete the only user account in the group Admins. The group Admins must have at least one user account. If you want to delete this account, create a new account and add it to the group Admins, or add an existing account to the group Admins, and then delete the account.
    
- You tried to put a user in a group to which the user already belongs, by appending either a  **Group** object to a **User** object's **Groups** collection that already has a **Group** object of the same name or a **User** object to a **Group** object's **Users** collection that already has a **User** object of the same name.

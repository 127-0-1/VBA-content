Only databases created with version 3.0 or later of the Microsoft Jet database engine can be replicated. Although you can open the database by using an installable ISAM, you cannot convert it to a replicable form. If the database was created by using an earlier version of Microsoft Jet, convert the format to the newer version. If the database is in another format, export the data to a new Microsoft Access database and retry.

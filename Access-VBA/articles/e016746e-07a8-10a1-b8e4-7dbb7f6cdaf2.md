 **Last modified:** December 30, 2015

This index is a cross-reference to the ADO Language Reference based on Microsoft Visual C++.

If you use the  **#import** directive in your application, a header file will be generated that will enable you to use syntax similar to Microsoft Visual Basic. Property names of the form **get_** _PropertyName_ and **put_** _PropertyName_ can be treated as if they were declared simply as _PropertyName_. A property can then be treated like a data member instead of a function.
All of the methods, properties, and events are functions that return an  **HRESULT**, which you can test to determine if the function executed successfully.
Method and property syntax in Visual C++ is listed for the following elements:

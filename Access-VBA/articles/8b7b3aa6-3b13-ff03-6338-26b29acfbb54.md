Possible causes:

You are using the same field twice in an index or relationship, which the Microsoft Access database engine does not permit.
You are creating a relationship using fields with data types that do not match. In Microsoft Access database engine databases, you can only relate fields with identical data types or a AutoNumber field with a Number field set to a Long Integer.

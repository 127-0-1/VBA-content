
# Specify the table containing the records you want to delete. (Error 3128)

You tried to execute a delete query but the query does not specify the name of the table containing the records you want to delete.

Possible cause:


- You did not type an asterisk for each table in the ALL, DISTINCT, DISTINCTROW predicates. Instead, you typed field names (for example,  `Customers.Address` instead of `Customers.*`).

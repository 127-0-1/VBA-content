
# Synchronizer <name> is also using the same File System dropbox <name> (Error 3630)

Each Synchronizer should have a unique file system dropbox. Using the same dropbox location for multiple Synchronizers can result in lost messages and incomplete exchanges. The applicatin is unable to create the signal file because it is already opened by another transporter.

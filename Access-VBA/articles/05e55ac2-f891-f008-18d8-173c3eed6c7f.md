You can use the chart control to embed a chart that displays Microsoft Access data from a form or report. You can then edit the chart by using Microsoft Graph from within the form or report.


## Remarks

When you place a chart control on a form or report, Microsoft Access displays the Chart Wizard to help you create the chart.


 **Note**  To embed or link a chart containing data from other applications, use an [unbound object frame](4A0874DC-ECAC-BE7C-25E2-ECC79696E2EB.md) or[bound object frame](9D087A78-278D-1B87-D1B4-22F836707EFA.md) control.

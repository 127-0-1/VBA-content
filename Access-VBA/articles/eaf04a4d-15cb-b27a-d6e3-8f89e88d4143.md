You tried to create or rename a table with a name that already exists in this database. Choose another name, and then try the operation again.

In a multiuser database, this error can also occur if you delete a table, another user creates a table with the same name, and then you try to roll back the deletion of your table. To restore your table, the other user must first delete or rename the new table before you try the rollback operation again.

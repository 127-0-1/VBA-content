A check box on a form or report is a stand-alone control that display a Yes/No value from an underlying record source.


## Remarks

When you select or clear a check box that's bound to a Yes/No field, Microsoft Access displays the value in the underlying table according to the field's  **Format** property (Yes/No, True/False, or On/Off).

You can also use check boxes in an option group to display values to choose from.

It's also possible to use an unbound check box in a custom dialog box to accept user input.

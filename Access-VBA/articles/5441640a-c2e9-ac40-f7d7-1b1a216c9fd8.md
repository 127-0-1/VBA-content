 **Last modified:** December 30, 2015

 _ **Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016_

Possible causes:



- You tried to open a non-Microsoft Access database engine database, such as a Btrieve, dBASE, or Paradox database or table. Instead, link the database or table to an existing Microsoft Jet database.
    
- You tried to import or link a Paradox database or table, and the associated .px file could not be found. Make sure the .px file is the same directory as the Paradox database or table, and then try the operation again.
    
- If the specified database is a Microsoft Jet database, it is corrupted. You should attempt to repair the database. If the database cannot be repaired, restore the database from a backup copy, or create a new database.


# Syntax error in Transaction statement. (Error 3708)

 **Last modified:** December 30, 2015

 _ **Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016_

When using transactions exclusively through the Microsoft Access database engine (not through an object model like DAO or ADO) the following syntax must be used: BEGIN/ROLLBACK TRANSACTION, WORK or nothing. If any other characters follow BEGIN or ROLLBACK, then this error will occur.

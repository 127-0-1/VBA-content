
# Crosstab query contains one or more invalid fixed column headings. (Error 3322)

 **Last modified:** December 30, 2015

The list of entries for a fixed column heading of a crosstab query (the PIVOT clause in a TRANSFORM statement) is not valid.

Possible causes:


- There are no entries in the list. There must be at least one value in the parentheses following the IN reserved word in the PIVOT clause.
    
- A blank entry appears in the list. Two commas in a row (,,) create a blank entry.
    
- The list contains a field name of more than 64 characters.
    

Correct the PIVOT clause and execute the query again.

## Example

This Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macro shows how to use the  **DrawArcByThreePoints** method to draw an arc on the drawing page.


```
Public Sub DrawArcByThreePoints_Example 
 
 Dim vsoShape As Visio.Shape 
 Set vsoShape = ActivePage.DrawArcByThreePoints(3, 3, 6, 8, 5, 5) 
 
End Sub
```
